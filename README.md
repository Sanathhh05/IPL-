# IPL

📘 Project Overview

This project is an end-to-end IPL Data Analysis and Prediction System built using Python and Power BI. It explores multiple aspects of IPL data through preprocessing, modeling, and interactive visualizations.

The dataset consists of four CSV files containing detailed IPL information such as matches, teams, player performance, and statistics. The data was thoroughly cleaned, transformed, and prepared using Python to ensure reliability and accuracy.

A Random Forest Classifier was implemented to build predictive insights—such as determining match outcomes or player performance trends—based on historical data. The trained model provides robust predictions due to its ensemble learning structure.

To present insights effectively, a fully-interactive Power BI Dashboard was developed. It showcases key metrics, trends, comparisons, and predictive results in a user-friendly visual format.

🚀 Key Features

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Handled missing values, feature engineering, normalization, and dataset merging using Python (Pandas, NumPy).

Machine Learning Model: Implemented a Random Forest Classifier for prediction tasks with high accuracy.

Exploratory Data Analysis: Extracted insights and relationships within IPL data.

Power BI Dashboard: Visualizes match insights, team performance, player comparisons, and model predictions.

End-to-End Pipeline: From raw data → preprocessing → modeling → interactive dashboard.
